# github-green

This repository exists to make one commit to GitHub every day.

A scheduled GitHub Action updates the README with unrelated daily items. This content is secondary.

The update can use fallback data, skip a section, or reuse a safe previous
value when a source is unavailable.

## Daily automation

The workflow runs at 7:17 AM in `America/Chicago` and can also be run manually
from the Actions tab. It needs repository variables `COMMIT_NAME` and
`COMMIT_EMAIL`; the email must be associated with the owner's GitHub account.

The workflow retries a rejected push once after rebasing. It cannot guarantee a
contribution during a GitHub outage, missing write permission, bad repository
authentication, disabled Actions, or an unresolved push conflict.

## Content health alerts

After ten consecutive failed Chicago dates for a live provider, the workflow
opens or reopens one GitHub issue. GitHub email or web notifications can deliver
that alert outside the repository.

External content sources and attribution requirements are documented in
[docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md).

The delivery order is in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
