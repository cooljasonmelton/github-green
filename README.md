# github-green

This repository exists to make one commit to GitHub every day.

A scheduled GitHub Action updates the README with unrelated daily items. This content is secondary.

The update can use fallback data, skip a section, or reuse a safe previous
value when a source is unavailable.

>My current employer uses Bitbucket so even though I'm out here coding my ass off, I no longer have a gloriously green contribution chart. This project's purpose is to hack the contribution chart so I get at least one daily commit and keep it green.

## Daily automation

The workflow aims to run at 7:17 AM in `America/Chicago` but GitHub can delay or skip scheduled runs, so that time is not guaranteed. It can also be run
manually from the Actions tab.  It needs repository variables `COMMIT_NAME` and
`COMMIT_EMAIL`; the email must be associated with the owner's GitHub account.

The workflow retries a rejected push once after rebasing. It cannot guarantee a
contribution during a GitHub outage, missing write permission, bad repository
authentication, disabled Actions, or an unresolved push conflict.

## Content health alerts

After ten consecutive failed Chicago dates for a live provider, the workflow
opens or reopens one GitHub issue. GitHub email or web notifications can deliver
that alert outside the repository.

External content sources and attribution requirements are documented in
[docs/sources.md](docs/sources.md).

The delivery order is in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
